# Fraud Detection with Random Forest

This project demonstrates how to use a Random Forest classifier to detect fraudulent transactions in a credit card dataset. The dataset is highly imbalanced, and the model is trained to achieve high performance on the minority class (fraudulent transactions).

## Features
- **Dataset**: The Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle.
- **Model**: Random Forest Classifier.
- **Evaluation**: Confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy score.
- **Feature Importance**: Visualizes the most important features in the dataset.

## How to Run
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle: [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).
2. Place the `creditcard.csv` file in the project directory.
